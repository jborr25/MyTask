//Instance variables are declared inside a class but outside any method.
//They are unique to each class instance, meaning each object created from the class has its own copy of these variables.
//Instance variables are variables that belong to an individual object of a class. 
//Each object created from a class has its own copy of instance variables. 
//This allows objects to maintain their own state and behavior.
